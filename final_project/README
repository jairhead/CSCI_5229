----- ABOUT THIS PROGRAM -----

--- DESCRIPTION OF KEYS ---
  - 0: reset viewing angle
  - 1: cycle between two display modes (projection and first person)
  - In projection display mode:
    - '+': increase field of view
    - '-': decrease field of view
  - In first person display mode:
    - arrow keys: turn left, turn right, look up, look down
  - ESC: exit the program
  - 'm' or 'M': manually cycle between weather conditions
  - 'r': print parameters to terminal (only without GLEW)

--- EXTERNAL RESOURCES ---

--- WHY THIS PROJECT DESERVES AN A ---
  - I created all .obj files in the scene from scratch, including:
    - clock.obj
    - hillyGrassValley.obj
    - mountainRim.obj
    - mountainSnow.obj
    - rainDrop.obj
    - snowFlake.obj
    - star.obj
  - Was challenging to create a mountainous landscape from scratch
    that looked believable and reacted to weather conditions
  - Created an analog clock face that displays the current time with accurate
    hour and minute hands
  - Made all objects in the scene react to time of day and weather conditions
  - Paid close attention to animating snow, rain, and mixed precipitation:
    - Performed lots of trial and error with the rain fall speed
    - Added "meandering" to the snow as it falls so it appears to blow around
      as it falls
    - Added a thunderstorm weather condition with random lightning effect
  - Worked hard to carefully animate day and night cycles:
    - Created sunrise and sunset effects with smooth sky color changes
    - Added twinkling effect to stars

--- REMAINING WORK ---
  - Definitely going to add:
    - Blue-to-orange sky gradient for sunset and sunrise
    - Add a partly cloudy weather condition with skybox textures
    - Created a pine tree object and create a forest with it
    - Tall grass object for grassy area
    - Log cabin with a porch for the first person view to stand on with an outdoor lamp, window, and door
    - I ran into difficulties placing textures onto the landscape due to the following error (unable to load the material):
      Utilities::loadMaterial(): cannot open file.
  - Might add:
    - Road with cars driving by
    - Snow-covered effect for all objects
