The makefile will build the gears program for Linux, OSX or Windows.

On Windows the -DUSEGLEW compiler flag invokes GLEW which is required to get
OpenGL 2 features needed by this program.

On OSX the -DRES=2 compiler flag adjusts the resolution of the glViewport() for
retina displays.  If you see only part of the scene, it may be necessary to
change this to -DRES=1.
