--- DESCRIPTION OF KEYS ---
  - arrow keys: change viewing angle
  - 0: reset viewing angle
  - 1: set MODE = 1 to update the value of sigma (used in Lorenz Attractor calculations)
  - 2: set MODE = 2 to update the value of beta (used in Lorenz Attractor calculations)
  - 3: set MODE = 3 to update the value of rho (used in Lorenz Attractor calculations)
  - 4: set MODE = 4 to update the value of dt (used in Lorenz Attractor calculations)
  - 5: set MODE = 5 to randomly generate a new color to redraw the Lorenz Attractor with
  - 6: set MODE = 6 to enter crazy gradient mode!
  - +: increase value of current MODE parameter
  - -: decrease value of current MODE parameter
